For this reason, Iso JYM is a go-to supplement for everyday use. It delivers the most protein per calorie when compared to protein powders that use protein concentrates or milk protein isolates, and it’s perfect to help meet your macros on protein without going over on carbs and fats.",

The WPI in Iso JYM goes through a specific microfiltration process that removes lactose and doesn’t harm the small protein molecules from the whey. The result is a whey product with a protein concentration of 90% or more for maximum uptake and digestibility."
